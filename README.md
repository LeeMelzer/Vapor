# Vapor

Vapor is an application for a curated list of video games to purchase for your PC. The primary PC app for distributing video games, Steam, does not curate games and can end up with a lot of rough, incomplete, and broken games on their store. Vapor app is an application software for android devices that allows the user to purchase steam keys for games on our list. It keeps a library for the keys they have purchased. It also has sorting functionalities for genreâ€™s and popularity or publisher to allow users to seek which games they should play next. The 6 genres we will sort for are Action, Role-playing, Strategy, Adventure, Simulation and Sports and Racing. Users will be able to create accounts and save their payment information for purchases.
